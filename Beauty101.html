	<ol>
		<li> <h3> ALWAYS remove your makeup before bed.</h3> 
			<p> It is so important to remove makeup before bed to avoid acne and irritation. Makeup can trap dirt, oil and pollutants from the environment on your skin. The accumulation will clog pores, removing your makeup allows your skin to breathe and recover. </p>

		</li>
		<li> <h3> Don’t forget your SPF!</h3>
			<p> Harmful rays from the sun can cause wrinkles, pigmentation, dark spots and as well as skin cancer. Sunscreen not only protects your skin and prevent breakouts; it also helps make your skin glow and look lively. </p>

		</li>
		<li> <h3>“You are what you eat”</h3>
			<p>This saying is catchy and true. Making sure you eat nutrient rich foods can help you feel good and look good. Your skin will thank you for eating foods with high antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids and probiotic-rich choices.  </p>

		</li>
<li> <h3>Sheer face</h3>
			<p>To achieve a dewy look, moisturizer mixed with foundation can create a sheer and more comfortable wear.  </p>

		</li>
		<li> <h3>Brush your teeth before your skin care routine</h3>
			<p> Toothpaste residue can irritate the skin and cause acne, dryness or redness around your mouth and skin. Best to brush your teeth and then cleanse your skin right after, every morning and night! </p>

		</li>
		<li> <h3>Heat up your eyelash curler!</h3>
			<p> Just like how you curl your hair, you need heat. To curl your lashes, use heat. A blow dryer or lighter will do the trick! However, make sure the curler is hot enough to still touch before using around your eyes for the best result! </p>

		</li>
			<li> <h3>Apply the right mascara and curl the best way</h3>
			<p> First curl your lashes and hold for 30 seconds (With a little heat!), next use a waterproof mascara as the first layer, after a few minutes, apply a layer of traditional mascara, after a few minutes curl for 10 seconds (NO HEAT). Thank us later. </p>

			<li> <h3>We can’t forget the hair!</h3>
			<p> We know that putting perfume on your pulse areas makes it last longer, such as your neck or wrist. Spray a little on your hairbrush and 
brush through your hair. An unforgettable smell for anyone you meet. 
 </p>

		</li>
					<li> <h3>Pink powder!</h3>
			<p> If you haven’t gotten your hands on a pink powder… You are missing out! Pink powder should only be used in the under-eye area (Not all around your face! Use a translucent powder for that!). Pink powder helps brighten complexion and can be a serious gamechanger to your makeup routine.
 </p>

		</li>
		<li> <h3>Clean those nasty brushes!</h3>
			<p> Its common sense, however we all know damn well we don’t do it enough! Use a cleanser or soap with no fragrance and wash your brushes with water. You can get a brush cleaner mat to get into all those spots! However, if you don’t have one of these, use a towel to scrub your brushes on! Allow a good amount of time between your brushes drying and application.
